XMLFileRenamer (github.com/sealocal/xml_file_renamer)                                  Apr 2014
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I created a FileRenamer class to rename 2,900 XML files for my TideData project.
The string name I needed was a text node in the XML. Give the executable command
line arguments of a directory path and space-delimited tag names to rename XML
files. Check out the awesome README for details.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Provides high and low tide for any day, given a particular location. I wrote a
data scraper for NOAAâ€™s published tide predictions for this project. In the future,
I will add maps, switch to using a database model instead of XML files, then
possibly switch to an API integration.
